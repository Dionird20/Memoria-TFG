\end{center}

Cardiac event supervisors monitors abnormalities in the Electrocardiography (ECG) record of patients who carry them in their daily lives, in real time, allowing abnormal ECG segments to be stored, and even transmitted. Therefore, they must be designed both to minimize their consumption and cost, and to present high reliability in the real-time detection of cardiac abnormalities. Detection of the heartbeat contained in an ECG segment is usually the first step in classifying it as abnormal. In this Degree Final Project, a benchmark environment has been developed to realistically evaluate the performance of beat detection algorithms in embedded systems with limited computing capabilities. The system is made up of a TIVA series C, on which the algorithm to be tested is executed, connected to a computer that allows interaction with the user through a graphical interface based on Qt. For its validation, a basic beat detection algorithm has been used, also implemented in this DFP, the MIT-BIH ECG database and the guidelines of the UNE-EN 60601-2-47 standard for testing portable heart monitors.
